## Why?

I spend too much time writing READMEs. Somehow every README I've written is virtually the same, but none of them look alike. **The goal of this project is to standardize and streamline the README writing process.** 

## Menu

Below are a collection of different READMEs.

### Basic Template

There's a basic formula that should be followed when writing a README:

1. Name
2. Short introduction
3. Prerequisites
4. Installation
5. Usage
6. Contributing
7. Contributors & Acknowledgements
8. License

### Spicy Template

There's some easy additions to spice up a README:

1. Add a logo
2. Center text
3. Add badges
4. Add images (bonus points for GIFs)
5. Use emojis

### Personal Template

Recently, GitHub added the option to pin a README to profiles. GitHub actions and some NodeJS make it easy to make it dynamic!
